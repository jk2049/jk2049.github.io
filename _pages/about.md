<p align="justify"> My research interests lie in platform strategy and consumer behavior with applications in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), recommendation systems, and online streaming. To address my research questions, I employ a mix of methods including machine learning, econometrics, and field experiments. <br /></p>

<p align="justify"> My work has been accepted for presentation at several peer-reviewed international conferences, including the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), Workshop on Information Systems Economics (WISE), and Conference on Information Systems and Technology (CIST). <br /></p>

<p align="justify"> Previously, I worked as a Customer Insights Analyst at Burberry and as a Marketing Analyst at Mattel. I hold a Ph.D. in Business Analytics in Information Systems from Rotterdam School of Management, an M.Sc. degree in Business Analytics from Imperial College London, where I received a distinction, and a B.Sc. degree in Management Science and Technology from the Athens University of Economics and Business, graduating summa cum laude. <br /></p>
